one4all README

This is a one LUA script to run all LUA scripts.
You don't need to know LUA or scripting to merge different scripts to have them all working for you.
Only thing you must to do is to copy what you want from "modules/available" directory to "modules/active" directory, and then configure every one module in "modules/active" directory for you needs.

Couple of rules thought:
1) You must start this Conky LUA by "one4all-start.sh" - just type it in terminal or add it to session startup;
2) You may copy this same module from "modules/available" to "modules/active" directory as many time as you wish - just change it's filename;
3) Characters allowed in module names are letters ("[a-zA-Z]"), numbers ("[0-9]"), dot (".") and underscore ("_");
3) Module filename must have ".module" extension;
3) You allowed to change settings part of module only - if you change anything else it may break;

Have a fun.
